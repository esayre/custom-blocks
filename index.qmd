<!-- ## To-do -->

<!-- * handling listings -->
<!--    * ToC style -->
<!--    * box style -->
<!-- * links -->
<!--    * links within the doc (cross ref) -->
<!--    * links outside the doc (footnote to references?) -->
<!--    * cross ref & index for case studies -->
<!--    * dictionary terms / index -->
<!-- * boxes -->
<!--    * DONE! boxes for fyi, cases, warning, exercises -->
<!--    * boxbox for 2 and 3 across.  -->
<!--    * boxbox for column and page across. -->
<!-- * Chapters -->
<!--    * abstract from the yaml headers to the latex -->
<!--    * authorship -->
<!--    * Might be able to get inspiration from the foldbox.lua on this? -->
<!-- * Parts? as a top level heading? As just a break, but the chapter numbers stay continuous? -->

<!-- ### CSS? latex headers? -->

<!-- * margin note sizing for text? -->
<!-- * DONE! color definitions for boxes -->
<!-- * chapter & heading styling in pdf -->
<!-- * striped tables -->

<!-- ## Boxes -->

<!-- - to replicate other studies or compare across groups. -->

<!-- New strategy: define a wide environment, and then put a table in it.  -->
<!-- Another new strategy: Define an enclosing box and then just put the two inside it, not side-by-side. -->

These chapters:

- make tacit professional knowledge more explicit, particularly around fundamental practices of research; 
- are short, friendly, and have actionable exercises;
- support a wide range of people to become better at their work: students just getting started, new faculty, venerable advisors, casual researchers, and postdocs conceptualizing their first independent research.

The practical fundamentals of doing research are widely applicable across a vast majority of research projects. Some of these practical fundamentals are centered on education research, while others are broadly applicable across many fields of research.  I try to balance broad coverage with brevity.

The [table of contents](articles) for this handbook suggests a reading order.

## Images?

![What do emerging researchers need? Word cloud from several hundred emerging researchers](images/research-needs.png){fig-alt="A word cloud of what emerging researchers need" width="50%"}

In education research, there are also a lot of people who get started without a direct mentor. 

### H3s look like this

They might get started by participating in a [field school](https://peerinstitute.org/), workshop, or conference.  

#### H4s look like this. 

They might transition into education research as a natural extension of their other professional duties.
