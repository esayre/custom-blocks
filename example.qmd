## Custom blocks and crossreferencing

With this filter, you can define custom div classes (environments) that come with numbering, such as theorems, examples, exercises. The filter supports output formats pdf and html.

::: Feature
### Numbering
Numbering is (currently) within section for single documents, or within chapter for books. Grouped classes share the same counter, and the same default style.

Numbered custom blocks can be cross-referenced with `\ref`.

Default numbering can be switched off for the whole class by setting the `numbered` to false, or for an individual block by adding the class `unnumbered`.
:::

::: {.Feature title="Block box style"}
The default style for custom divs is `fancybox`: a collapsible similar to quarto's callouts, with a collapse button at the bottom that makes it easier collapse long boxes, and box open to the right. It comes with the variant `fancybox.simple`, with closed box and no additional close button.
:::


## Pseudomath examples

::: Definition
### F$\alpha$ncybox
A box is called *f$\alpha$ncybox* if it looks quite fancy. 

In this context, by *fancy* we mean that the title of the box appears as a clickable button when rendered as html, where *clickable* implies that it throws a small shadow that becomes bigger when hovering over it.
:::

::: {.Conjecture #TeachersHope}
Students are lured into clicking on the title and unfolding the fancybox. 
::: 

::: {.Theorem #TeacherHopes collapse="true"}
This extension has been written by a teacher who hopes that students read the course notes...
:::

Theorem \ref{TeacherHopes} is suggested by Conjecture \ref{TeachersHope}, but it cannot be proven theoretically. It does give rise to more conjectures, though.

::: {.Conjecture .unnumbered}
The teacher mentioned in Theorem \ref{Teacherhopes} is a statistician who got addicted to quarto due to James J Balamuta's web-r extension, and desparately wanted to have a common counter for theorem and alike.
:::

## Future plans

Here are some of the features planned for future releases.

::: TODO
### Custom styles
- [ ] create an API for user defined block styles
- [ ] provide an example
- [ ] and documentation
:::

::: TODO
### Custom list of blocks
Make lists of selected block classes available as `qmd` , optionally intermitted with headers from the document for easy customization and commenting.
This way, one could make a list of all definitions, examples, or {theorems, propositions and lemmas} etc.
